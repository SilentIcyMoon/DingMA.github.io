Hi, I'm Lester Violeta, a master's student at Nagoya University, Japan at Toda Laboratory under the supervision of Professor Tomoki Toda. My research focus is mainly on automatic speech recognition and voice conversion using different deep learning frameworks with a particular focus on minimally-resourced datasets. I received the Monbukagakusho Japanese Government Scholarship, a full scholarship that covers my expenses while studying in Japan. I am also scheduled to take the PhD course next April as a Fellow of the Nagoya University Interdisciplinary Frontier Fellowship. I work on AI with the goal of making it more inclusive to everyone.

Prior to this, I received my undergraduate degree from Ateneo de Manila University, Philippines. I also have several working experiences in software engineering and machine learning. Moreoever, I was also a research exchange student at Institut Catholique d'Arts et Metiers - Site de Paris-Senart in France where I worked on optimizing renewable energy systems for a semester during my undergraduate degree.

Some of my hobbies include language learning, where I learned French during my exchange program and am currently studying Japanese. Having this hobby led me to gain an interest in research in speech and languages, so here I am!
