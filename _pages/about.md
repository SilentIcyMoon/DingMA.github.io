About Me
======
Hi, I'm Lester Violeta, a master's student at Nagoya University, Japan at Toda Laboratory under Professor Tomoki Toda. My research focus is mainly on automatic speech recognition using different deep learning frameworks. I received the Monbukagakusho Japanese Government Scholarship, a full scholarship that covers my expenses while studying in Japan. I work on AI with the goal of making it more inclusive to everyone.

Prior to this, I received my undergraduate degree from Ateneo de Manila University, Philippines. I also have several working experiences in software engineering and machine learning. Moreoever, I was also a research exchange student at Institut Catholique d'Arts et Metiers - Site de Paris-Senart in France where I worked on optimizing renewable energy systems for a semester during my undergraduate degree.

Some of my hobbies include language learning, where I learned French during my exchange program and am currently studying Japanese. Having this hobby led me to gain an interest in research in speech and languages, so here I am!
